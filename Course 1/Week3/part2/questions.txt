1. Write a method named coldestHourInFile that has one parameter, a CSVParser named parser. This method returns the CSVRecord with the coldest temperature in the file and thus all the information about the coldest temperature, such as the hour of the coldest temperature. You should also write a void method named testColdestHourInFile() to test this method and print out information about that coldest temperature, such as the time of its occurrence.

NOTE: Sometimes there was not a valid reading at a specific hour, so the temperature field says -9999. You should ignore these bogus temperature values when calculating the lowest temperature.

2. Write the method fileWithColdestTemperature that has no parameters. This method should return a string that is the name of the file from selected files that has the coldest temperature. You should also write a void method named testFileWithColdestTemperature() to test this method. Note that after determining the filename, you could call the method coldestHourInFile to determine the coldest temperature on that day. When fileWithColdestTemperature runs and selects the files for January 1â€“3 in 2014, the method should print out
