6. Write the method averageTemperatureWithHighHumidityInFile that has two parameters, a CSVParser named parser and an integer named value. This method returns a double that represents the average temperature of only those temperatures when the humidity was greater than or equal to value. You should also write a void method named testAverageTemperatureWithHighHumidityInFile() to test this method. When this method runs checking for humidity greater than or equal to 80 and selects the file for January 20, 2014, the method should print out
